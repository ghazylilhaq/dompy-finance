# Product Brief: NeoBudget

## 1. Project Overview
NeoBudget is a modern, frontend-only personal finance application designed with a bold **neobrutalism** aesthetic. It allows users to track their income, expenses, budgets, and account balances in an intuitive and visually distinct interface. The application is built to be responsive and interactive, focusing on a unique user experience through high-contrast design elements.

## 2. Target Audience
*   Individuals seeking a straightforward tool for personal finance tracking.
*   Users who appreciate modern, high-contrast, and distinctive UI designs over traditional clean corporate styles.
*   Developers or users looking for a lightweight, frontend-focused budgeting solution that can be easily extended or integrated with a backend.

## 3. Primary Benefits & Features
*   **Comprehensive Dashboard**: Instant view of total balance, monthly income/expenses, and recent transactions.
*   **Transaction Management**: Robust table view with filtering (search, type, category) and a dialog form to easily add new transactions.
*   **Budget Monitoring**: Visual progress bars for budgets with color-coded health indicators (Green/Safe, Yellow/Warning, Red/Over Budget).
*   **Organization**: Dedicated views for managing **Categories** (income vs. expense) and **Accounts** (Cash, Bank, E-Wallet, Credit Card).
*   **Distinctive Design**: Consistent neobrutalism theme featuring thick borders, hard shadows, and vibrant colors for high visual engagement.

## 4. High-Level Tech & Architecture
*   **Framework**: **Next.js 15** (App Router) with **TypeScript 5**.
*   **Styling**: **Tailwind CSS 4** combined with custom neobrutalism design tokens (bold borders, hard shadows).
*   **UI Library**: **shadcn/ui** (based on Radix UI primitives) for accessible and customizable components.
*   **Data Handling**: Currently utilizes local JSON data models (`/data`) and `date-fns` for date manipulation, structured as a frontend-only application.
